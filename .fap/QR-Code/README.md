# QR-Code Enhanced

This flipperzero-qrcode project was originally developed by [bmatcuk](https://github.com/bmatcuk/flipperzero-qrcode). The changed version creates an folder called "QR-Codes" in the apps_data folder and automaticly opens it when the application is launched.


## Tutorial

### 1. Beginners

Simply drop the `.fap` file into the `apps` directory on your Flipper Zero SD card using qFlipper/[Flipperlab](https://lab.flipper.net/) or manually.

### 2. Professionals

If you're experienced, you know what to do with the counter folder. Just drop it inside `user_applications` and compile it with [`fbt`](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/fbt.md) or [`ufbt`](https://pypi.org/project/ufbt/).
